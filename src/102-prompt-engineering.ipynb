This approach enables an LM to self-evaluate the progress through intermediate thoughts made towards solving a problem through a deliberate reasoning process. The LM's ability to generate and evaluate thoughts is then combined with search algorithms (e.g., breadth-first search and depth-first search) to enable systematic exploration of thoughts with lookahead and backtracking."
